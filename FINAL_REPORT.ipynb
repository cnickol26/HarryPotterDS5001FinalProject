    "This project consisted of a corpus made up of the 7 Harry Potter books. Written by J.K. Rowling in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Harry Potter is the best selling book series in history. The books are all written in the fantasy genre with varying lengths and number of chapters. For this analysis, I looked at the books both individually and together using an OHCO of book, chapter, paragraph, sentence, and token. After an extensive amount of work to create the vocab and corpus tables, I looked at things such as TFIDF, correlations, PCA, LDA and topic modeling, word2vec, sentiment analysis, and semantic search.

    "I thought these two dendrograms in particular were very interesting. Using different linkage methods, they both produced the same results. Books 1 and 7 seem to be outliers compared to the rest. I think this makes sense given the context of what happens in these books. Book 1 is the first one and a lot of the book is explaining the world of Harry Potter so a lot of the book is not at Hogwarts or school related. The same thing occurs with book 7 as it is the only book where he doesn't attend Hogwarts for school, just the final battle occurs there. Beyond that, I think it makes sense that 4, 5, and 6 would be linked, because these are all about Voldemort coming back and regaining his powers. 2 and 3 are similar stories Hogwarts stories with a lot of character development for Harry and everyone else while at school."
